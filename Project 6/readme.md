# Bay Wheels user data 
## by Kihun Kim

## Preliminary Wrangling : Motivation 

Have you ever tried to ride on shareable bike? Bay Wheels is one of shareable bike provider in US.Original dataset that we will use for this study,is saved by user data.That means we can get Information about how long,where and when Customer used this services. Moreover this project is more about visualization not wrangling.Therefore wrangling part will be presented minimum to concentrate more on visualization 

## Summary of finding

> 1.` Univariate analysis` : In this part only one variable was implemented for visualiztion.In exploration templates you can find 3 different kinds of graph.Especially `pie chart`,`countplot` and `lineplot` were applied.`Pie chart` shows the proportion of different type of bike user.And from countplot we can get a information about top 5 start and end station which are popular for bike user.From the last one was represent the time series of bike demand. Thoughout is easy to take which time is the highest peak time for customer.

> 2.` Bivariate analysis` : Bivariate or in the others word binary means two.As you might guess this analysis method uses two variables form dataset. In exploration templates you can 3 different kinds of plotting skills. First grpah is represented by `countplot`.That is actually not so much different than before,It was just added distinguisher equal use type. The next one is the highlight of this project, `Mappping` the each bike station on the real map cards by using latitude and longtitude data.In the end scatterplot with regression line represent the duration of individual bike id. 

> 3.` Multivariate analysis` : Multivariate means more than 2 variables.First visualization that you can find in the exploration templates is not big different before.I just expanded one more 'shape distinguisher' with user type.Last one is called 'Facetgrid'.Helping with Facetgrid you can build a kind of m by n matrics that you can custermize with many different type of variables.  



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Presentation is not showing all visualizations that I worked on the exploration template.i picked one visualization result for each anaiysis. That shows the relevant characters of main features that I choose from the beginning of the explartion template.Moreover find out important insight of relationship about sub feature with the main features or just among the sub features.
