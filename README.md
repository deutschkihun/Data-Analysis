# Data-Analysis 

In this repository you can learn about how to start analyzing many differnt type of data 


## Project 1 : Comparison of global temperature 
- In this project following contents are covered
  1. How to load the csv file
  2. Basic skill of Matplotlib and seaborn 
  3. Interpretation of analysis from graph 

## Project 2: No-show appointment 
- This data comes from Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).
- Throughout you can learn about basic libraries in practical way like pandas,numpy and matplotlib

## Project 3: A/B Testing with statistics
- A/B Test is most popular statistical method to help rational decision of business in company
- In order to understand this project following knowledges are required
  1. normal distribution/binomial distribution 
  2. Confidence interval 
  3. P-value
  4. Regression / Multiple Regression / Logistic Regression 
  5. Hypothese Testing 
  6. Bootstraping 
  7. Probability 
- Throughout you can learn statistical method with practical dataset


## Project 4 : Visualization case study 
- In this project following contents are covered
  
 1. Univariate Exploration of data 
 2. Bivariate Exploration of data
 3. Multivariate Exploration of data
 

## Project 5 : WeRateDog 
-WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.That means there are ratings greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10.

-Wrangling WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.There are 3 kinds of files that you have to gather,asssess and clean it properly.
-In this project following contents are covered 

 1. Gathering : CSV,TSV,JSON with txt files. 
 2. Assessing : head,tail,sample,describe.... and Finding quaility and tidiness issuse. 
 3. Cleaning : clean **'Validation'.'Consistency','Completence','Accuracy'** issuse with many different fuctions and tools.
 
 
 ## Project 6 : Bay wheels's user dat 
 
Have you ever tried to ride on shareable bike? Bay wheels is one of shareable bike provider in US.Original dataset that we will use for this study,is saved by user data.That means we can get Information about how long,where and when Customer used this services. Moreover this project is more about visualization not wrangling.Therefore wrangling part will be presented minimum to concentrate more on visualization 

**structure**
1. Bivariate Exploration of data :  Single variable visualization
2. Univariate Exploration of data : Two variables visualization
3. Multivariate Exploration of data : More than 2 variables visualization
