## Project 4 : Visualization case study 
  
 > Part1: Univariate Exploration of data 
 > Part2: Bivariate Exploration of data
 > Part3: Multivariate Exploration of data
 

## Project 5 : WeRateDog 
- WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a     denominator of 10.That means there are ratings greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10.

Moreover this project is more about visualization not wrangling.Therefore wrangling part will be presented minimum to concentrate more on visualization 

> Part1: Bivariate Exploration of data :  Single variable visualization
> Part2: Univariate Exploration of data : Two variables visualization
> Part3: Multivariate Exploration of data : More than 2 variables visualization
